# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following images referenced in the website:

## Required Assets:
1. `CAR.png` - Racing car image for the navigation bar
2. `FH2025 Black Logo nav.png` - Formula Hacks 2025 logo for navigation

Please copy these images from your original project's assets folder to this location.

## Note:
The Next.js app is configured to load images from the `/public` folder. Files in this folder are served at the root path.

For example:
- `/public/assets/CAR.png` is accessible at `/assets/CAR.png` in the app
